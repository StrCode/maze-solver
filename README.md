# Maze Solver using Python and Tkinter

Hello, this respository contains one of my first python projects which uses Tkinter to create a Maze solver


## Running the Maze Solver
If you want to run the project start by cloning the project, after which you run this command

`python main.py`


I will be updating this project with some new features such as being able to set the amount of cells and also maybe ability for you to solve the puzzle yourself
